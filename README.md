# VentureVerse

VentureVerse is a simple, social idea board where founders and builders can share startup ideas and the community can vote on them. It's designed to help surface promising concepts, spark conversation, and give visibility to early-stage ideas.

## What it does

- Post your startup idea with a short title and description.
- Browse ideas submitted by others.
- Vote on ideas you like (upvotes help good ideas rise).
- Optionally comment and discuss ideas (if enabled in the app).

This repository contains a Next.js app that implements the VentureVerse frontend and basic routing.

## Who is it for

- Founders looking for feedback and validation.
- Builders searching for interesting projects to join.
- Investors and mentors browsing early concepts.

## Quick start (local development)

1. Install dependencies:

```pwsh
npm install
```

2. Run the development server:

```pwsh
npm run dev
```

3. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Notes:

- This project uses Next.js app routing. The primary UI files live in the `app/` directory.

## Project vision & UX notes

- Ideas should be short and focused — a title and a one-paragraph description.
- Voting should be lightweight (one upvote per user) to quickly surface community interest.
- Future improvements can include authentication, idea categories/tags, and idea comments.

If you'd like, I can also add a short usage guide for submitting and voting on ideas, or include screenshots and a CONTRIBUTING.md. What would you like next?
